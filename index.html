						<h1>Oh hey there.</h1>
						<h2>I'm Alex, a plant eco-physiolgist passionate about stress tolerance in conifers of the mountain west.</h2>
						</header>						
						
						<p>My research interests span several aspects of one foundational question: if, how, when, and to what degree do forest tree species develop stress mitigation and tolerance strategies, particularily when facing multiple, simultaneous stressors (e.g. drought, heat, freezing, and shade)? I use western montane conifers as a model to investigate these questions and their downsteam consequences on forest structure and function in the context of a changing change.</p>

						<p>Currently, I am a research associate at the University of Montana in the lab of <a href="https://www.umt.edu/biological-sciences/default.php">Dr. Anna Sala</a> where I manage and execute all aspects of a <a href="https://pamspublic.science.energy.gov/WebPAMSExternal/Interface/Common/ViewPublicAbstract.aspx?rv=a4fa5d71-ae90-4ba4-a7bd-5617e5da93d4&rtc=24&PRoleId=10">DOE-funded collaborative research project</a> investigating the impact of interacting drought, NSC depletion, and mycorrhizal network connectivity on water relations in ponderosa pine.</p> 

						<p>I also contribute to ongoing research on fruit tree physiology and management at <a href="https://www.musacchi-orchardmanagement.com/index.php">Washington State University</a>. There, I focus on developing near-infrared spectroscopy models for non-destructive fruit quality estimation, and attempt to disentangle the complex relationships between the fruit quality parameters we measure with instruments vs. the way consumers perceive flavor and make purchasing decisions. In addition, I help establish management recommendations for the new (and exceptionally tasty!) apple cultivar <a href="https://cosmiccrisp.com/">Cosmic Crisp®</a>.</p>

						<h2>Seeking Collaborators/Software Testers!</h2>
						<a class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/stickwatr.png" alt="" /></a>
						<p>StickWatR is a graphical user interface I am developing for the measurement of plant hydraulic conductance based on the <a href="https://sperry.biology.utah.edu/methods.html#hydraulic_conductivity">Sperry hydraulic apparatus</a>. Powered by R/Shiny, StickWatR's point-and-click interface creates a user-friendly experience that streamlines and simplifies data collection - no coding knowledge required! Features include real-time visualization of flow rates, user-defined criteria for determining stability, data validation checks, and automatic calculation of specific conductance and conductivity that can be exported to easy-to-manage Excel files. StickWatR currently supports data inputs from <a href="https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/?filter_series=0d9ea3cf-626e-42a6-bb39-c0cd9c6447c6">Sensirion liquid flow sensors</a>. I am seeking collaborators to expand StickWatR's functionality with different forms of data inputs (e.g., various models of analytical balances). If you use balances or other models of flow meters in your hydraulic apparatus and are interested in developing this program with me, let's connect!</p>

								<h3>Mycorrhizal Networks and NSC Depletion Impacts on Plant Water Relations</h3>
								<p>Forest trees often form beneficial relationships with fungal networks by exchanging carbon for nutrients - but these associations may become unfavorable when carbon is limiting such as periods of drought when stomatal closure limits photosynthetic assimilation. By manipulating rainfall, light availability, and mycorrhizal network connectivity in the field, I am working to understand how non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) concentration interacts with mycorhizzal connectivity in influencing water relations, specifically turgor maintenance and hydraulic vulnerability to embolism in ponderosa pine forests of western Montana.</p>

								<a class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/polytolerance.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<h3>Conifer Polytolerance</h3>
								<p>Developing tolerance to one stressor generally directs resources away from developing tolerance to another, and thus a trade-off occurs. Conifers, which occupy some of the most abiotically challenging terrestrial landscapes, are often exposed to multiple, simultaneous stressors (e.g. drought, freezing, shade). Do trade-offs in stress tolerance occur in conifers? If so, what are the underlying morpho-physiological mechanisms? How might these trade-offs contribute to overall forest resilience with ongoing climate change?</p>

								<a class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/seedlings.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<h3>Seedling Stress Physiology</h3>
								<p>Germinants of tree species often occupy microclimatic envelopes quite different from adult conspecifics, which raises questions about species' capacity to tolerate stress in seedlings vs. adults. What physiological and anatomical traits are coordinated with environmental stress (particularly drought) throughout life history, and when/how do these trait assemblages in seedlings become reflective of those displayed by adults?</p>

								<h3>Drought in the Subalpine Rocky Mountains</h3>
								<p>Despite cooler temperatures and frequent storms, high-elevation Rocky Mountain tree species are exceptionally water-limited - particularly at the seedling stage. <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2021/07/15/colorado-monsoon-season-drought-wildfires-climate-change/">Mediated by the weakening of the North American Monsoon</a>, will subalpine spruce-fir communities be able to withstand increasing frequency and intensity of summertime droughts? To find out, I am investigating the effect of drought on recruitment and seedling performance using precipitation exclusion shelters in the field.</p>

								<h3>Fruit Dry Matter & Consumer Acceptance</h3>
								<p>Ensuring a consistent eating experience across harvests, orchards, and even individual fruit is a challenge in the tree fruit industry given immense variability in growing and handling practices. Fruit dry matter is increasingly recognized as a <a href="http://treefruit.wsu.edu/article/using-dry-matter-to-increase-consumer-liking-and-retail-purchase-price-of-danjou-pear/">reliable indicator of fruit quality</a>. Using non-destructive near-infrared spectroscopy, I aim to develop models to assess fruit dry matter accurately and rapidly in both field and packhouse settings as a decision aid for growers and handlers. I also seek to establish correlations between fruit quality parameters (including dry matter) and consumer eating experiences in association with the <a href="https://sfs.wsu.edu/sensory/">Sensory Science Lab</a> at Washington State University.</p>

								<h3>WA38/Cosmic Crisp® Apple</h3>
								<p><a href="https://cosmiccrisp.com/">Cosmic Crisp®</a> is the delicious result of a 1997 cross between cv. Honeycrisp and Enterprise apple developed at <a href="https://foundation.wsu.edu/2019/12/01/cosmic-crisp/">Washington State University</a>. With over 12 million trees planted in 2019, it is the largest introduction of any horticultural commodity in history. I work to provide <a href="http://treefruit.wsu.edu/cosmic-crisp-characteristics-and-horticulture/">actionable management recommendations for growers</a> to promote yield, fruit quality, and long-term orchard viability for this exciting new cultivar.</p>
